# Welcome to Chess Music!
<img alt="GitHub branch checks state" src="https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/mherrerarendon/chessmusic/Rust/main"><br/>
This is a WIP rust sample project that gets pgn formatted games from lichess, parses the moves, and then produces midi data based on the moves.

Unit tests have been added, but haven't had a chance to setup code coverage yet.
